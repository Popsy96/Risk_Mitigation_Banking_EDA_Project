# 💸 Loan Default Prediction: Risk Mitigation Analysis through EDA in Banking Sector 🚀

## 📜 Project Overview
Loan defaults are one of the trickiest challenges faced by financial institutions—leading to losses, bad debts, and sleepless nights! 😓

Using **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and **Machine Learning**, this project dives into the hidden patterns within loan application data to predict which borrowers might default on their loans.

## 🔍 Problem Statement
**Loan Defaults = Trouble** ❌

### 🏆 **Objective**:
To build a predictive model that flags high-risk borrowers **before** they default. This enables lenders to:
- 🛡️ Protect their investments
- 📊 Optimize loan approval decisions
- 📈 Boost profitability by reducing risk!

## 📊 Datasets
I worked with two main datasets:
1. **`application_data.csv`**: Key details about each applicant at the time of loan application.
2. **`previous_application.csv`**: Historical data on borrowers’ past loan applications.

## 🧠 Analysis Process
I performed:
- **Univariate Analysis**: Understanding individual features (e.g., income, loan amount, etc.)
- **Bivariate Analysis**: Uncovering relationships between features (e.g., income vs. loan approval)
- **Multivariate Analysis**: Understanding complex patterns (e.g., how income, credit history, and home ownership affect loan default probability).
